## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### `spotDL` Not Found Error

If you encounter errors indicating `spotDL` is not found:

1.  Verify that Python is correctly installed on your system.
2.  Ensure `spotDL` is installed globally: `pip install spotdl`.
3.  Confirm `spotDL` installation by running: `spotdl --version`.

### Download Failures

If downloads are failing:

*   Check your internet connection.
*   Ensure the Spotify URL is valid and publicly accessible.
*   Verify that `spotDL` is properly installed and configured.
*   Review the server logs for more detailed error messages.

### Performance Issues with Large Playlists

For very large playlists:
